What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When we initialize a repository it creates a hidden '.git' folder to track changes
and commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is a logical area (manual addition of files to this space) that is prepared for a commit.
It reduces redundancy in the repository by not keeping tracking files that have not changed since the last commit.
