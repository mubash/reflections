When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When working on another computer
-Low on space locally
-Refreshing local machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual pull gives more control . What if we are in the middle of code changes locally when automatic pull kicks in, this would cause conflict.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
I would use forks to create my own edits to an existing repository that I can't make changes to. Then clone the fork to have local access and make changes.
I would add branches if I am trying something experimental and don't want it to affect the main production branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To avoid too many conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Knowing about Git now, it will be harder to collaborate on anything else now. But,
if I have to choose, I will use Box or Google drive.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Changes in separate branch makes sense when there is a risk of conflict with other collaborators.
Separate branch allows each individual collaborator to make their own edits beforing merging it all
with master.
