When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-When working on another computer
-Low on space locally
-Refreshing local machine

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual pull gives more control . What if we are in the middle of code changes locally when automatic pull kicks in, this would cause conflict.
