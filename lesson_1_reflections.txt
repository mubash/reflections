How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
This was pretty neat and I can see how this is super helpful with long files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It gives me a snapshot and helps if I ever want to revert to a previous value

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manually choosing to commit gives more user control and relies on users to make the judgement call.
On the other hand auto save can get cluttered very fast and be useless.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Software code version control systems need to track multiple files that only work together hence the
multi-file commit. G docs is primarily is document repository where each doc in independant of the
other document, so multi-file commit in not needed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
'git log' is used to show varies commits along with their IDs.
Then 'git diff {ID1} {ID2}' can be used to compare the differences.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Looks pretty straightforward

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
start with a small project
